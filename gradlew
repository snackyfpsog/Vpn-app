#   Gradle start up script for POSIX generated by Gradle.
#
#   Important for running:
#
#   (1) You need a POSIX-compliant shell to run this script. If your /bin/sh does
#       not find so, but you have some other compatible shell such as ksh or
#       bash, then change the shebang line above to whatever is appropriate.
#
#   (2) Gradle will search for your gradle home in this order:
#
#       a) If a custom GRADLE_HOME environment variable is specified, use it
#       b) If this script is in the gradle-wrapper.jar's parent folder, use the path to that folder
#       c) If this script is in the gradle-wrapper.jar's parent folder, use the path to that folder
#
#   (3) This script is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
#       WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
#       MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
#       General Public License for more details.
